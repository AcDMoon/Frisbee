        <p class="fs-3">It was an ordinary day at my new job. The sun was shining, everyone was in a good mood, in general, life was going on as usual. But at one point, toward evening, in my company's chat room, a couple of employees I didn't know invited everyone over for pizza to celebrate their birthdays. It ran through my head, "Oh shit, I didn't even know about this, didn't even congratulate these people! And even if I had known it was their birthday, I wouldn't have known what to get them!"</p>
        <p class="fs-3">This situation struck a nerve with me. I decided that it would be nice to create a service that would help me and others not to get into such situations.</p>
